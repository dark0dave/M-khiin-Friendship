# M'Khiin-Friendship
This mod introduces a short friendship path with M'Khiin during Siege of Dragonspear. It includes four timer-based talks, additional conversations responding to key story moments, and expanded interjections when appropriate.

## FAQ

### Q: You are not the author of this mod!

A: Correct, I am a caretaker until the original owner returns. See the follow g3 [thread](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/39622-bucketfullofsunshine/#comment-350332).

### Q: What are your current plans for the mod? 

A: The mod is content complete. Outside of bugs or translation additions (if any), I don't plan to update it. I *may* make changes as other SoD mods release (e.g. Reflections of Destiny) to keep it compatible. 

### Q: Why does M'Khiin seem out of character?

A: Players have their own interpretations of canon characters. While I think she remains in-character, you may feel differently. I also don't claim to perfectly replicate her speech. If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd be delighted to hear them / implement them (with thanks and credit). 

## CHANGELOG

* 1.0 - Initial release.
* 1.1 - Tra-ified the mod. 
* 1.2 - Lowercasing and cleanup of scripts.

## LICENSING
* My mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests or alter content. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. commentary to vanilla quests), crossmod is free real estate. You can contact me to co-write / co-code it. Or simply add the crossmod on your end without my involvement.

* M'Khiin isn't even my OC. She's a canon character I'm expanding on. Honestly -- go wild. Change the talks completely. Remove the PID. Add to the PID. Reword lines you don't like. Write your own, completely seperate M'Khiin friendship mod that's considerably better than mine. The sky's the limit.

## SPECIAL THANKS

* The usual suspects. Wes Weimer for *Weidu* & Argent77 for *Near Infinity + WeiDU Notepad++ Highlighters*.
