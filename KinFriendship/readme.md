# M'Khiin-Friendship
This mod introduces a short friendship path with M'Khiin during Siege of Dragonspear. It includes a four timer-based talks, additional conversations responding to key story moments, and expanded interjections when appropriate.

## FAQ

### Q: Why does M'Khiin seem out of character?

A: Players have their own interpretations of canon characters. While I think she remains in-character, you may feel differently. I also don't claim to perfectly replicate her speech. If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd be delighted to hear them / implement them (with thanks and credit). 

### Q: The flesh is weak!

A: Even in death I serve the Omnissiah! :3

## CHANGELOG

* 1.0 - Initial release.
* 1.1 - Tra-ified the mod. 

## LICENSING
* My mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests or alter content. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. commentary to vanilla quests), crossmod is free real estate. You can contact me to co-write / co-code it. Or simply add the crossmod on your end without my involvement.
* M'Khiin isn't even my OC. She's a canon character I'm expanding on. Honestly -- go wild. Change the talks completely. Remove the PID. Add to the PID. Reword lines you don't like. Write your own, completely seperate M'Khiin friendship mod that's considerably better than mine. The sky's the limit.
